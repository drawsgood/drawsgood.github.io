			<div class="detail-text"><h2 class="description">Meet The Kings</h2><p>Each pip, number and face card were designed and illustrated in an amazing pixel art/sprite editing application called Aseprite. The pips were iterated on to ensure legibility.</p></div>

				<div class="detail-text"><h2 class="description">The Tuck Box</h2><p>The tuck box was designed in Aseprite as well, pixel by pixel. I wanted something simple and elegant, so in the end I decided on a clean white tuck box with silver embossing. Both the full size and micro pip designs adorn the box, as well as the 8Bit logotype.</p></div>
